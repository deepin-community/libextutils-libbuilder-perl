Description: Perl module to compile standard, self-contained C libraries
 Some Perl modules need to ship C libraries together with their Perl
 code. Although there are mechanisms to compile and link (or glue) C
 code in your Perl programs, there isn't a clear method to compile
 standard, self-contained C libraries.
 .
 ExtUtils::LibBuilder's main goal is to help in that task.
